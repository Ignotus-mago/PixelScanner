/**
 * <p>
 * PixelAudioMapper is the parent class for child classes that map a 1D "signal" array of
 * floating point numbers to a 2D "image" array of integers. It makes assumptions about the
 * range of values in these arrays, detailed below. This class specifically handles the one-to-one
 * mapping between the signal and the image arrays. The mapping is handled by lookup tables
 * created by a separate mapping generator class. If you think of the signal as a space-filling
 * curve that visits each pixel in the image, one lookup table is a list of index numbers of
 * each pixel it visits, in the order it traverses them. It uses the table to "look up" the
 * pixels in the image array. There is a similar lookup table for the image that allows you
 * to look up the corresponding value in the signal array.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some typical uses for this class include:
 * <ul>
 * 	  <li> Reading an audio file or audio stream into the signal array and then writing its
 *		transcoded values to the image array for display as a visualization.</li>
 *	  <li> Using interaction with an image to trigger audio events at precise locations in a signal.</li>
 *    <li> Running audio filters on an image-as-signal and writing the results to the image.</li>
 *    <li> Running image algorithms on a signal-as-image and writing the results back to the signal.</li>
 *    <li> Synthesizing image data and audio and then animating the data while interactively
 *      triggering audio events. </li>
 *  </p>
 *
 * <h2>DATA REPRESENTATION</h2>
 * <p>
 * For the sake of generality, the enclosing types for image and audio data are implemented outside
 * this class. In Processing, PImage wraps image data. I have been using the minim library for audio,
 * (https://code.compartmental.net/minim/) but the built-in audio in Processing 4 is definitely an option.
 * </p><p>
 * Within this class, image pixels are represented as an array of ints, and audio samples are represented
 * as an array of floats. Processing.core.PImage.pixels can provide the int array. Whatever audio class
 * you use can provide the float array.
 * </p><p>
 * The image array contains standard 24- or 32-bit RGB or RGBA pixel data, in row major order,
 * with (0,0) at upper left corner. The signal array contains values in the range [-1.0,1.0],
 * a standard format for audio values. It is up to the implementation to devise methods to convert
 * values from signal to image and vice versa: unless my default methods suit your purpose,
 * you should override the transcode() methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Image</h3>
 * <pre>
 *	 Width w, Height h
 *	 Index values {0..(w * h - 1)} point into the pixel array.
 *	 Index to coordinate conversion for row major order with index i, width w, height h:
 *		i = x + w * y;
 *		x = i % w; y = i/w   // using integer math;
 *	 Default data format: 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA, for display from a bitmap to a computer monitor.
 *	 RGBA includes an alpha channel A.
 * </pre>
 * <h3>Signal</h3>
 * <pre>
 *	 Array with same cardinality as image data array {0..(w * h - 1)}
 *	 Default data format: floating point values in the range {-1.0..1.0}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>LOOKUP TABLES</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * At their most general, lookup tables or LUTs set up a one-to-one correspondence between two arrays
 * of the same cardinality, independent of the format of their data values. Every element in one array
 * corresponds to exactly one element in the other array. Starting from array A, for an element at index
 * A[i] we find the index of the corresponding element in array B at aToBLUT[i]. An element j in array B
 * has the index of its counterpart in array A at bToALUT[j].
 * </p><p>
 * In PixelAudioMapper, we employ two LUTs, signalToImageLUT and imageToSignalLUT, to map elements in signal
 * or image to the corresponding position in image or signal.
 * <pre>
 *	signalToImageLUT: integer values over {0..(h * w - 1)} map a signal array index to a pixel array index
 *	imageToSignalLUT: integer values over (0..(h * w - 1)} map an image array index to a signal array index
 * </pre>
 * In signalToImageLUT, we can get the pixel index in the image for any index in the signal.
 * In imageToSignalLUT, we can get index in the signal for any pixel index in the image.
 * </p><p>
 * Each array is the inverse of the other: for an array index i:
 * <pre>
 *	signalToImageLUT[imageToSignalLUT[i]] == i;
 *	imageToSignalLUT[signalToImageLUT[i]] == i;
 * </pre>
 * </p><p>
 * Image data is always in row major order for PImage, our image data class. Signal values can be mapped
 * to locations in the image in any arbitrary order, as long their coordinates traverse the entire image.
 * A typical reordering might be a zigzag from upper left to lower right of an image, or a space-filling
 * fractal, or even a randomly shuffled order. The coordinates of each pixel in the image are stored as
 * indices (i = x + w * y) in signalToImageLUT.
 * </p><p>
 * Once we know the “pixel index” for each value in the signal and have initialized signalToImageLUT,
 * we can initialize imageToSignalLUT:
 *	<pre>
 *	for (int i = 0; i < w * h - 1; i++) {
 *		imageToSignalLUT[signalToImageLUT[i]] = i;
 *	}
 *  </pre>
 * </p><p>
 * Accordingly, we set up the PixelAudioMapper constructor to generate signalToImageLUT first and then generate
 * imageToSignalLUT from signalToImageLUT. It uses a subsidiary class to do this.
 * </p><p>
 * Note that the same LUT could be used by multiple instances of PixelAudioMapper, as long as it is in effect
 * a static variable. The LUT for a 512 x 512 pixel Hilbert curve can be calculated once and copied to
 * or called by every PixelAudio instance that maps a signal to a 512 x 512 bitmap using a Hilbert curve.
 * A call to the PixelMapGen.generate() method will provide a signalToImageLUT which can be used by
 * all PixelAudioMapper instances with the same width and height.
 * </p><p>
 * Currently, I am using a PixelMapGen instance as an argument to the PixelAudioMapper constructor.
 * First create a PixMapGen instance with the width and height of the image you are addressing. The PixMapGen
 * instance will generate the LUTs for its particular mapping for you. You can then pass it to the
 * PixelAudioMapper constructor, which will initialize its variables from copies of the PixMapGen LUTs.
 * Some of the logic behind this process is explained in my notes to the PixMapGen abstract class.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>MAPPING AND TRANSCODING</h2>
 * <p>
 * We typically use the LUTs whenever we change the data in the signal or the image and want to write
 * the new values to its counterpart, updating the appearance of the image or the sound of the audio signal.
 * If the values in the arrays are in different formats, we will need to transcode the values from one
 * format to the other. We have two methods, in pseudocode here:
 * <pre>
 *	mapSigToImg		map signal values to the image: img[i] = transcode(sig[imgLUT[i]]);
 *	mapImgToSig		map image values to the signal: sig[i] = transcode(img[sigLUT[i]]);
 * </pre>
 * The img variable in the pseudocode corresponds to an array of RGB data from a bitmap class.
 * The sig variable corresponds to an array of floating point samples from an audio class.
 * Implementation of the transcode() method is left to child instances of PixelArrayMapper.
 * </p><p>
 * In addition, we can write image or signal values directly, without using the LUTs. This operation transforms
 * the order of the pixel or signal values.
 * <pre>
 * 	writeImgToSig	write image values directly to the signal: sig[i] = transcode(img[i]);
 *	writeSigToImg	write signal values directly to the image: img[i] = transcode(sig[i]);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>READING AND WRITING SUBARRAYS</h2> // TODO rewrite this section
 * <p>
 * When we want to work with subarrays of data from the signal or the image, it can be ordered either
 * by the signal or image array order or by mapping with the corresponding LUT. In the case of images,
 * we also have standard methods of reading and writing rectangular selections. We can define some
 * methods to read and write data either in the order determined by the signal or by rectangular
 * areas in the image. We’ll call the former methods pluck (read) and plant (write), and the latter
 * peel (read) and stamp (write). The method signatures may be sufficient to determine the order of values
 * when reading or writing, but it may clarify things to modify the name.
 * </p><p>
 * When data to be written is not in the format of the target array, it will have to be transcoded first.
 * In the following, intArray contains pixel data and floatArray contains signal data.
 * Pos is an index into the signal, x and y are locations in the image. The length parameter is associated
 * with the array order of samples or pixels. The w and h parameters work with rectangular areas mapped
 * from the image. When we call peel or stamp on signal data, length should be equal to w * h for
 * a given rectangular area of the image.
 * </p><p>
 * Arguments to mapping and writing methods are written so that source precedes target. Using this convention,
 * most methods have a unique signature that also indicates how they function. Where there are ambiguities or
 * a need for clrification, I have renamed the function, as in pluckPixelsAsFloat, pluckSamplesAsInt,
 * peelPixelsAsFloat, and peelSamplesAsInt.
 *
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>ARRAY SHIFTING<?h2>
 * <p>
 * Standard operations we can perform with the signal array:
 * <pre>
 *   shiftLeft()		an array rotation where index values decrease and wrap around at the beginning
 *   shiftRight()		an array rotation where index values increase and wrap around at the end
 * </pre>
 * Shifting has proved so useful for animation that I am including it in the class. The shift methods also demonstrate
 * how to update the signal and pixel arrays.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>OTHER OPERATIONS</h2>
 * <p>
 * The following are suggestions for methods that could be implemented in children of PixelArrayMapper.
 * <ul>
 *	 <li>audio synthesis (the WaveSynth algorithm used in the animation for Campos | Temporales)</li>
 *	 <li>pattern generation (the Argosy pattern algorithm for Campos | Temporales, https://vimeo.com/856300250)</li>
 * 	 <li>phase shifting, amplitude modulation, etc. </li>
 *	 <li>FFT operations on both image and signal data</li>
 *	 <li>pixel sorting, typically on image data</li>
 *	 <li>blur, sharpen, etc.</li>
 *	 <li>blending images</li>
 *	 <li>mixing signals</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>UPDATING AUDIO AND IMAGE</h2>
 * <p>
 * As a rule, operations on the signal should be followed by writing to the image, and operations
 * on the image should be followed by writing to the signal. This will keep the values synchronized,
 * even though they have different numerical formats.
 * </p><p>
 * In most of the examples that accompany this library, audio data uses the Lightness channel of an
 * HSL representation of the image's  RGB data, but this is by no means the only way of doing things.
 * Using the Lightness channel  restricts audio data to 8 bits, apt for glitch esthetics, but noisy.
 * It's also possible to  maintain high resolution data in the signal by processing image and audio
 * data separately, and  writing audio data to the image but not in the other direction.
 * </p><p>
 * Finally, it bears mentioning that the image can be treated as simply an interface into an audio
 * buffer, where events such as mouse clicks or drawing and animation trigger audio events but do not
 * modify the audio buffer. Library examples will provide some suggestions for this strategy.
 * </p>

	/**
	 * Replaces a specified channel in an array of pixel values, rgbPixels, with a value derived
	 * from an array of floats, buf, that represent audio samples. The supplied lookup table, lut,
	 * is intended to redirect the indexing of rgbPixels following the signal path. We are stepping
	 * through the buf array (the signal), so rgbPixels employs imageToSignalLUT to find where each
	 * index i into buf is pointing in the image pixels array, which is rgbPixels.  Upon completion,
	 * the pixel array rgbPixels contains the new values, always in the RGB color space.
	 *
	 * All three arrays, rgbPixels, buf, and lut must be the same size.
	 *
	 * In the HSB color space, values are assumed to be floats in the range (0..1), so the values
	 * from buf need to be mapped to the correct ranges for HSB or RGB [0, 255]. We do some minimal
	 * limiting of values derived from buf[], but it is the caller's responsibility to constrain them
	 * to the audio range (-1..1).
	 *
	 * @param rgbPixels an array of pixel values
	 * @param buf       an array of floats in the range (-1..1)
	 * @param lut		a lookup table to redirect the indexing of the buf, typically imageToPixelsLUT
	 * @param chan      the channel to replace
	 * @return			rgbPixels with new values
