/**
 * Interface for classes that map values in a one-dimensional array (signal)
 * to a two-dimensional bitmap (image), usually in orders other than
 * the usual left to right and top to bottom (x,y) scan line order.
 * You can think of the signal as a function that traverses every pixel in
 * a bitmap. PixelScannerINF implementations implement the function and its
 * inverse however they see fit. A lookup table will do, and so will a
 * mathematical function. The mapping can be accessed with the lookup()
 * and xcoord() and ycoord() functions. Values can be read from and
 * written to the signal and the bitmap data structures using the plant()
 * and pluck() methods. Again, the implementation is up the the user,
 * though the image data structure is necessarily (for now) a regular
 * old bitmap, typically a Processing PImage, and both signal and map
 * employ 24-bit RGB or 32-bit ARGB values. Backing arrays in other formats
 * can be used in an implementation where a high-resolution audio signa
 * is considered useful.
 *
 * PixelScanner classes generally do not implement the 1-D signal or 2-D image
 * data structures themselves, they provide methods to map points in an image to
 * positions in a signal and vice versa. In the sample classes in this library, the
 * mapping is accomplished with integer arrays. The image and signal data structures
 * that are implemented in external code are typically a 1-D array of floating point or
 * integer values for signals and a standard 2-D bitmap array for images, encoded
 * in horizontal scanline rows and vertical columns.
