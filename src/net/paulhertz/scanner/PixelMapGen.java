/**
 *
 * Abstract class for handling coordinates and LUT generation for PixelAudioMapper. PixelAudioMapper is designed to be independent 
 * of any specific mapping between its audio and pixel arrays. It uses PixelMapGen classes as plug-ins to obtain values for its LUTs.
 * Keeping the LUT generation class outside PixelAudioMapper removes dependencies on the particular mapping.
 *
 *
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 * The PixelAudioMapper class handles the combinatorial math for mapping between two arrays whose elements are in one-to-one correspondence
 * but in different orders. This class, PixelMapGen, generates the mapping between the two arrays. PixelAudioMapper, as its name suggests,
 * considers one array to be floating point audio samples and other to be RGBA integer pixel data, but of course the relationship is
 * completely arbitrary as far as the mapping goes. The mapping was given its own class precisely because it is generalizable, though
 * PixelMapGen does assume that the cardinality of its arrays can be factored by width and height.
 *
 * One of the big questions for me to resolve just now is how tightly bound an instance of PixelMapGen should be to an instance of PixelAudioMapper.
 * -- We want PixelMapGen to be reusable, i.e., not so tightly bound to PixelAudioMapper as to be inaccessible to other code.
 * 	  - This suggests that PixelMapGen is initialized outside PixelAudioMapper then and passed to it.
 * 	  - PixelAudioMapper relies on PixelMapGen to generate lookup tables (LUTs) that map an audio sample array to a pixel array.
 *    - Once PixelAudioMapper has initialized its LUTs, PixelMapGen can be passed to another PixelAudioMapper.
 * So, should PixelMapGen act like a singleton, where the width and height values and the LUTs never vary, after they are generated? That's the second question.
 * -- Take into account that real-time multi-media performance is a goal of this library, so speedups are welcome
 *    - This is a major reason for using LUTs and arrays of coordinates, rather then math to update our arrays, map clicks on the image to audio offsets, etc.
 *    - LUTs also advance the potential for using OpenGL shaders to run the imaging routines, at some later time.
 *    - We also use threading to make response to timed and time-dependent more responsive.
 *    - Threading is used when playing audio samples: mouse-clicks are used to find positions in an audio buffer
 * -- It seems to make more sense in a multi-threaded environment *not* to share resources so as not to arrive at conflicts.
 * 	  - Processing overhead in my applications is very low and PixelMapGen instances are only read from, not written to.
 * 	  - Nevertheless, it probably makes sense for each PixelAudioMapper to have its own copy of required LUTs, rather than calling a PixelMapGen instance.
 * 	  - PixelMapGen provides methods to copy its resources, which only need to be calculated once, and they can be obtained at application initialization.
 * 	  - We use more memory by replicating LUTs, but in current architectures that is hardly a problem. In any case, we can also call PixelMapGen if we prefer.
 * -- In real-time performance situations, initialing all required resources for the performance up front is desirable, anyhow.
 * -- Another question: do we want a no-argument constructor for PixelMapGen?
 * 	  - A constructor requiring width and height seems really useful if we're handling bitmaps as one of our arrays.
 * 	  - Generality isn't really lost if a bitmap can have a height (or width) of 1, making it effectively 1D and of any cardinality we want.
 * 	  - Clearly this doesn't work for every generator: A Hilbert curve, for example, has some well-defined restrictions
 *    - A Hilbert curve could be initialized with a "depth" argument, so there's an argument for having a one-argument constructor
 *    - A no-arg constructor allows us to instantiate a PixelMapGen without setting any of its properties. This is potentially a source of problems.
 *    - I also can't see any advantages to the no-arg constructor. Delaying initialization is not an advantage for real-time performance. Do it all up front.
 *
 *
 * CONCLUSION
 *
 * Create a PixelMapGen instance with assigned width and height, and LUTs created by the generate() processes.
 * Initialize a PixelAudioMapper instance with the PixelMapGen instance, using copies of PixelMapGen resources.
 * In this way, decouple PixelAudioMapper instances from PixelMapGen in all later method calls.
 * But don't enforce this usage pattern with class structure, just make it the recommended practice (and see where that gets you).
