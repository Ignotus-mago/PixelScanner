PixelScanner is a Processing Library that provides an interface and various implementing classes for scanning 2D bitmaps to 1D arrays in pixel orders determined by space-filling curves such as a zigzag pattern, a Hilbert curve, and a Moore curve. I created it specifically to aid in a project that makes extensive use of Hilbert and Moore curves for creating a sort of _color organ_ where sine waves determine the mix of pixel values (i.e., colors).

PixelScanner is developed from the [**Processing Library Template**](https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template), traces of which will undoubtedly persist until I have everything edited. 

I am developing this library mostly to aid in developing several small apps where I want to handle the "scanning" of 2D images in a consistent way. I figured keeping the code in a library would assure that. It will also re-educate me on how to create libraries for Processing with the new template. I don't think the code for this library is particularly useful to the world at large, so I probably won't release it beyond leaving it here publicly in my repository. The expericence will help me to plan the next release of [**IgnoCodeLib**](https://github.com/Ignotus-mago/IgnoCodeLib3), an extensive library for P3+ featured on the Processing Libraries Page at [processing.org](https://processing.org) and in the P3 distribution.
