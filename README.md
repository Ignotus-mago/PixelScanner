PixelScanner is a Processing Library that provides an interface and various implementing classes for scanning 2D bitmaps to 1D arrays in pixel orders determined by space-filling curves such as a zigzag pattern, a Hilbert curve, and a Moore curve. I created it specifically to aid in a project that makes extensive use of Hilbert and Moore curves for creating a sort of **color organ** where sine waves determine the mix of pixel values (i.e., colors).
